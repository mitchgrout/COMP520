           ### Cryptanalysis of SHA-2 ###

   The SHA-2 family of hash functions is used widely in
   security to ensure the integrity of files, generate
   digital signatures, and securely store passwords. 
   
   In my project, I will consider current research on
   SHA-2, as well as research on already deprecated
   hash functions, and use these results to improve
   existing approaches to breaking SHA-2. The results
   of this project will help to determine whether or
   not SHA-2 is close to being broken, and if it should
   continue being used in security-critical applications.
