peed is an issue. Maj propagations take ~1s to run each, causes major slowdown.
Now using memoization for all three (key, add, maj), precomputed everything and
stored in /Scratch/. Maj roughly 100MB, takes ~8 hours to gen (serial,
        non-parallel). Computed at l2prob -4.000f.

Now takes ~3s to load everything, and propagations much faster.
Default std::stack uses a deque (linked-list) as an underlying structure for
storage. Change to stack<T, vector<T>>, 2x as fast for lookups roughly

!!!PROBLEM!!!
Re-read SHA-2 contra. Searching.
States that input differentials should “have a message expansion with diff. 0
for a large number of rounds” -- currently we are just randoming an input
without checking anything.

Add simple routine to walk through message expansion, at the moment making sure
we can actually  reach the final round.
