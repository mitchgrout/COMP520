Restart work
Long testing
Noticed lack of termination for long periods (sometimes 2h+ no termination)
    Sometimes very fast (<1s)
    Recursive defn. Hard to follow
    Bug: m |= (diff[i] == ‘x’? 1 : 0) << i – should be << 1

    Changed to iterative + stack
    Stack is just a static state* w/ static size/len

    Current pattern for holding samples is not good
    struct diff_prob contains differential + sample count
    but parent struct diff_vec contains the total sample count
    Decision: Give the propagation functions a thresh. Prob and have them set
              diff_prob with the actual differential + probability, and cull
              anything that doesnt meet the probability


              Tried to roll my own stack. Failed horribly. Overwrote random
              memory

              PROBLEM: THERE IS A DISCREPENCY BETWEEN STORING LOCAL VALUES FOR
              STATE INFO + STACK INFO. PROBABLY NOT ACTUALLY CAUSING THE CURRENT
              BUG.
