09/05:

Gave presentation to NICT etc
Explained that genetic algorithm not feasible due to EXPSPACE tree problem

Looked through code afterwards to try to print out genetic diffs as they were
generated

Actually got results?
Noticed that in my while(1) loop I forgot to add a break; + i never printed
genes until *all* were generated, meaning it only *seemed* that it was
intractible. On 8 rounds, it takes ~10-20s to generate a single good delta, with
genetic algorithms we get them in roughly a second? DOES INCLUDE DUPLICATES,
DOES NOT PROPERLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE HEURISTIC

Givse a better way of generating input differences rather than guess-and-check
