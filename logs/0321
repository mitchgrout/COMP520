21/03:
Began work on finding sufficient conditions for trails to hold
Currently no info about the trail is really stored, only intermediate state
Consider introducing a diffs[...] arr to struct prop_state to give a
representation to trailsa

PLAN:
Start with an input difference consisting of only first 7 types of bit
condition, i.e. 0un1x-?
Refine as we propagate
If we find #, impossible condition, we can backtrack

We should perform this step *while* performing propagation, to avoid
double-handling data

Difficult to know how propagation is going; maybe set up an ncurses CLI on a
seperate worker thread to continually update the user?

TODO: Test prior/posterior distribution using maw_diffs, determine how much of a
hit adding random sampling would be.

IMPORTANT: Bug found in prop_state
union { uint8_t a, b, c, d; uint32_t diff; }
=> a = b = c = d, all of the time.
!!!All trails prior to this are irrelevant!!!
Collisions are still valid
